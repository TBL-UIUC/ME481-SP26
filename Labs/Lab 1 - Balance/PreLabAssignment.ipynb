    "\n",
    "Reduced postural control (balance) is a symptom of many neuromuscular conditions including Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. As such, quantifying balance is common when studying many such conditions. In this lab, we will investigate how postural control (balance) is affected when sensory input is disrupted. To accomplish this, each student will perform a balance test under two conditions – eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC). To increase the differences that we observe between the two conditions, we will introduce further instability by completing the tests in tandem stance (heel-to-toe) instead of a standard quiet stance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of the lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand force plate technology** - Translate raw voltage signals from a force plate into corresponding forces and moments\n",
    "2. **Implement Signal Processing Techniques** - Frequency-domain analysis of timeseries signals and low-pass filtering to eliminate high-frequency noise in data\n",
    "3. **Calculate balance metrics** - Calculate center-of-pressure (CoP) position and construct stabilogram plots\n",
    "4. **Evaluate postural control** - compute and report common balance metrics used in scientific literature using your recorded data for two testing conditions\n"

    "### B. How Does a Force Plate Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The force plate contains **four load cells** positioned near each corner. Load cells are transducers that convert mechanical force into a small, measurable change in electrical resistance using bonded strain gauges on a deformable metal element. When the element experiences load, it strains; the strain gauges elongate or compress, changing their resistance.\n",
    "Here's the measurement process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load cells detect strain** - When you stand on the plate, each load cell experiences a small deformation (strain)\n",
    "2. **Strain gauges convert to electrical signal** - The deformation changes electrical resistance in strain gauges\n",
    "3. **Signal amplification** - These small electrical changes are amplified to create measurable voltages\n",
    "4. **Analog-to-digital conversion** - The analog voltage signals are converted to digital values that a computer can record\n",
    "5. **Calibration matrix applied** - A mathematical calibration (the sensitivity matrix) converts these voltages into actual forces and moments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The raw data you see in the force plate text files are **voltages**, not forces! We must apply a calibration matrix to convert voltages to forces.\n",

    "#### Understanding the Butterworth Filter Frequency Response Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above shows four different ways to visualize how a Butterworth filter behaves across different frequencies. Each subplot provides unique insights into filter performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plot 1: Effect of Filter Order (Top Left)**\n",
    "This shows how **filter order affects the sharpness** of the frequency cutoff. All filters shown here have a 10 Hz cutoff, but higher-order filters provide steeper transitions between the passband and stopband. **Order 4 is a common choice** in biomechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plot 2: Linear Magnitude Response (Top Right)**\n",
    "This shows **what fraction of the signal passes through** at each frequency:\n",
    "- **Passband (green)**: Frequencies below 10 Hz pass through nearly unchanged (magnitude ≈ 1.0)\n",
    "- **Cutoff point (10 Hz)**: Signal is attenuated to 0.707 of its original amplitude (the -3 dB point, representing 50% power loss)\n",
    "- **Stopband (red)**: Higher frequencies are progressively attenuated\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization helps you understand **how much of a signal at a given frequency is preserved** when using a filter with a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plot 3: Attenuation Percentage with Biomechanical Context (Bottom Left)**\n",
    "This is the inverse of Plot 2, showing **how much signal is removed** (rather than retained) and mapping filter behavior to **physiological phenomena**:\n",
    "- **Postural sway region (0.5-3 Hz, blue)**: <5% attenuation - signal preserved\n",
    "- **Physiological tremor (8-12 Hz, orange)**: 30-70% attenuation - partially removed\n",
    "- **Sensor noise (>50 Hz, red)**: >95% attenuation - effectively eliminated\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these frequency bands are approximate and idealized; actual data may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that a 10 Hz cutoff preserves postural sway while removing most noise. If you're studying tremor, you'd need a higher cutoff (15-20 Hz).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plot 4: Attenuation Table (Bottom Right)**\n",
    "This provides **exact numerical values** showing magnitude, attenuation percentage, and attenuation in dB at specific frequencies given a filter of the stated design. For example: \"At 5 Hz (upper range of postural sway), the filter attenuates only 1.6%, preserving 98.4% of signal amplitude, while at 50 Hz (sensor noise range), 99.8% attenuation removes nearly all noise.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection to Your Balance Lab Analysis**\n",
    "For this balance lab, your filtering goals are:\n",
    "1. **Preserve low-frequency postural sway** - where real CoP movement occurs\n",
    "2. **Remove high-frequency noise** - from sensors and electrical interference\n",
    "3. **Choose an appropriate cutoff** to balance these needs"

    "**What are decibels?** Decibels (dB) represent a logarithmic scale: power in dB = 10 × log₁₀(power in mV²/Hz). Logarithmic scaling compresses wide ranges of values, making small signals visible alongside large ones. For example, if one frequency has 10× the power of another, the dB difference is only 10 dB—much easier to see on a plot than the raw ratio.\n",

On a linear scale, the low-power noise would be hard to see. On a dB scale, both signal and noise are visible, helping you identify where to set the filter cutoff.\n",

    "**What it is:** Use the power spectral density (PSD) to see where your signal’s energy lives across frequency. Welch’s method (windowed, averaged FFTs) gives a smoother PSD than a single FFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Balance signals are low-frequency while sensor/environmental noise are higher frequency. A good cutoff keeps the low band and trims the high band.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cumulative power approach:** Integrate the PSD from 0 Hz upward to get cumulative power (% of total). Pick the frequency where cumulative power crosses a threshold (commonly 95–99%). That frequency is a data-driven candidate cutoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical steps:**\n",
    "- Compute PSD (Welch) with a window long enough to resolve low frequencies (e.g., 1–4 s windows for balance).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute cumulative power (%) and find where it reaches 95–99%.\n",
    "- Add a small safety margin above that point (e.g., +1–2 Hz) to avoid shaving real signal, but keep it well below Nyquist (≤0.4–0.5× Nyquist).\n",
    "- If multiple channels differ, choose the lowest reasonable cutoff across them or apply channel-specific cutoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Things to remember:** \n",
    "- Don't ignore Nyquist frequency (cutoff must be well below fs/2)\n",
    "- consider using channel-specific filters when some channels are much noisier."

    "## IV. Summary: Key Concepts Before Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "### Force Plate Basics\n",
    "- Force plates measure 6 degrees of freedom: 3 forces (Fx, Fy, Fz) and 3 moments (Mx, My, Mz)\n",
    "- Raw output is voltages, not forces - a calibration matrix converts voltages to forces\n",
    "- The center of pressure (CoP) is calculated from force and moment signals\n",
    "- CoP movement tells us about postural stability and balance control\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signal Processing\n",
    "- Real balance signals contain low-frequency components (< 10 Hz)\n",
    "- Sensor noise is high-frequency (> 50 Hz)\n",
    "- A low-pass filter removes high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency motion\n",
    "- Zero-phase filtering preserves the signal's timing and shape\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing Filter Cutoff Frequencies\n",
    "- Cutoff frequency must be high enough to preserve real body movement\n",
    "- Cutoff frequency must be low enough to remove sensor noise\n",
    "- Spectral analysis (cumulative power) helps us choose an appropriate cutoff\n",
    "- For balance data, cutoff frequencies are typically 4-15 Hz depending on the signal\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next in Lab\n",
    "In the actual lab, you will:\n",
    "1. Perform a tandem stance balance test on the force plate\n",
    "2. Export raw voltage data from the force plate software\n",
    "3. Convert voltage signals to forces using the calibration matrix\n",
    "4. Apply filtering to remove sensor noise\n",
    "5. Calculate center of pressure and balance metrics\n",
    "6. Analyze differences between Eyes Open and Eyes Closed conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck with the lab! Come prepared with the concepts you've learned here.\n"

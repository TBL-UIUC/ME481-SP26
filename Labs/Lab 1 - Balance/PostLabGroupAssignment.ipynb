    "\n",
    "Stabilogram-diffusion analysis (SDA) models CoP trajectories as one- and two-dimensional random walks and draws on statistical mechanics concepts (Collins & De Luca, 1993). The key idea is that while individual sway steps are unpredictable, the **mean squared displacement (MSD)** shows consistent statistical behavior, similar to Brownian motion. In SDA, MSD is computed for many time intervals $\\tau$ by averaging squared displacements between all pairs of points separated by $\\tau$; repeating this for increasing $\\tau$ produces the **stabilogram-diffusion plot**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given time interval $\\tau$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{MSD}(\\tau)=\\left\\langle\\left(\\mathbf{r}(t+\\tau)-\\mathbf{r}(t)\\right)^2\\right\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{r}(t)=[\\text{CoP}_x(t),\\ \\text{CoP}_y(t)]$ and $\\langle\\cdot\\rangle$ denotes averaging over all valid $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "SDA can be computed in multiple directions:\n",
    "- **Radial:** $|\\mathbf{r}(t)|=\\sqrt{\\text{CoP}_x^2+\\text{CoP}_y^2}$,  \n",
    "  $$\\text{MSD}_r(\\tau)=\\left\\langle\\left(|\\mathbf{r}(t+\\tau)|-|\\mathbf{r}(t)|\\right)^2\\right\\rangle$$\n",
    "- **AP:**  \n",
    "  $$\\text{MSD}_{AP}(\\tau)=\\left\\langle\\left(\\text{CoP}_y(t+\\tau)-\\text{CoP}_y(t)\\right)^2\\right\\rangle$$\n",
    "- **ML:**  \n",
    "  $$\\text{MSD}_{ML}(\\tau)=\\left\\langle\\left(\\text{CoP}_x(t+\\tau)-\\text{CoP}_x(t)\\right)^2\\right\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical stabilogram-diffusion plot shows **short-term** and **long-term** regions separated by a **critical point**. Collins & De Luca (1993) interpret these regions as reflecting **open-loop** (short-term, more stochastic) and **closed-loop** (long-term, feedback-driven) control. SDA is often visualized on both linear and log–log axes:\n",
    "- **Linear plot:** highlights absolute differences in sway magnitude.\n",
    "- **Log–log plot:** reveals scaling behavior and changes in control strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two parameter sets are commonly extracted:\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
